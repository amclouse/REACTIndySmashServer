# Smash-Indy

Smash-Indy (server) is intended to serve information to the Smash-Indy client with full CRUD capabilities. I've constructed this app with Express/Sequelize and utilization of several
npm packages such as JWT to create a fully functioning user validation feature. In combination with the client, Smash-Indy is a fullstack application intended to help fighting game
competitors organize and find information on tournaments happening around (but not limited to) the Indianapolis area. Fighting games are a favorite hobby of mine and millions
of others in the US, and around the world. I had a lot of fun creating this server back when I did, and I developed an aptitude for backend development. 


## Installation

After you have cloned the repo, be sure to run npm install to insert all of the necessary dependencies. This app uses nodemon to run in the background to restart the server
each time it is updated. If you do not have node project manager installed, please make sure to install it before you try and clone/run the app.

```bash
npm install
```
